## Summary
As large language models and harness frameworks continue to advance, agents operating in terminals are increasingly capable of performing a broader range of general computer-use tasks beyond coding. However, existing benchmarks do not adequately evaluate general-purpose terminal computer-use agents (TUAs): general computer-use benchmarks primarily target graphical user interfaces (GUIs), whereas terminal-based benchmarks largely emphasize technical and programming-centric workflows historically native to the shell. We introduce TUA-Bench, a general-purpose benchmark for terminal-use agents. TUA-Bench includes 120 real-world tasks across five task families, covering routine digital activities-including document editing, email management, and live-web information seeking-as well as scientific and engineering workflows co-designed with PhD-level domain experts that require specialized software. This breadth distinguishes TUA-Bench from prior shell-focused or domain-specific benchmarks. Each task is manually designed, runs in a real terminal with a deterministic setup script, and is evaluated by an execution-based scoring protocol. We find that the strongest frontier agent, Claude Code with Claude Opus 4.8 max reasoning effort, achieves 65.8% overall performance, with substantial gaps across both tracks. By providing a broad and realistic evaluation of terminal-use capabilities, TUA-Bench aims to accelerate the transition from narrow, task-specific assistants to general-purpose agents capable of operating reliably across diverse digital environments.

## Key points
- Worker summary: Terminal-use benchmark with 120 real-world tasks across routine digital work and domain-expert scientific/engineering workflows, each scored by execution-based checks.
- Worker candidate reason: Clears the bar because it fills a gap between GUI computer-use and coding-only terminal benchmarks: tasks run in a real terminal with deterministic setup scripts and execution-based scoring, and the reported best frontier agent reaches 65.8% overall rather than saturating the benchmark.
- Worker evidence: arXiv API metadata in discovery-arxiv.json and hf-read-2606.28480.md/Jina read report 120 tasks across five task families, deterministic setup scripts, execution-based scoring, and Claude Code with Claude Opus 4.8 max reasoning at 65.8% overall.

## Why it matters for agent evals
Clears the bar because it fills a gap between GUI computer-use and coding-only terminal benchmarks: tasks run in a real terminal with deterministic setup scripts and execution-based scoring, and the reported best frontier agent reaches 65.8% overall rather than saturating the benchmark.
